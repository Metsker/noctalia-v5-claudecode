# Claude Code Usage

Watch your Claude Code subscription burn down without leaving the bar: rate-limit
windows, token consumption, estimated cost, daily activity and a per-model breakdown,
refreshed in the background and mirrored into a bar pill, a click panel and a desktop
tile. Ported from the original [Dank Material Shell plugin](https://github.com/titeya/dms-claudecode)
by Nicolas Bellamy.

It reads the usage Anthropic already reports for your own account, using the credentials
Claude Code holds, so it covers the real subscription rate windows — the 5-hour
session, the plan-wide week, and the model-scoped week a plan carries when it has one
— rather than counting local tokens and guessing. There is no companion CLI to install and
no second config file to keep in sync: enable the plugin and the numbers are there.

Past the quota percentage it carries what a percentage alone leaves out — token counts
for today, this week and this month, their estimated cost in USD or EUR at live model
prices, a Monday-to-Sunday activity chart, a per-model breakdown for the week, all-time
session and message totals, and a selector for switching between CCS profiles. The bar
pill, the panel and the desktop tile all read one shared fetch, so putting up all three
costs one process.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `jrohland/claudecode` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `pill`; panel: `popout`; desktop widget: `panel`; service: `service` |

The `service` entry is headless and owns the single fetch loop; `pill`, `popout` and
`panel` are thin clients that watch the state it publishes. Entry ids are unique across
entry types, which is why the click panel is `popout` while the desktop tile keeps the
older id `panel`.

## Requirements

- A Noctalia build at plugin API level 26 or newer.
- An authenticated Claude Code install, i.e. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` exists.
- `jq` and `curl` on `PATH`. The service checks for both and reports a status instead of
  running when either is missing.
- `bash`, plus the usual base userland that `get-claude-usage` calls: `awk`, `grep`,
  `date`, `cut`, `tr`, `wc`, `cat`, `head`, `find`, `basename` and `mktemp`. These ship
  with coreutils, findutils and gawk on every supported distribution.

## Usage

Add the **Claude Code Usage** widget to a bar from the Add-widget picker. The pill shows
the chosen rate window as `NN%`, colored by pacing: neutral when you are on or under
pace, warning when over pace, error when over quota, with an `↑` cue when you are off
track. Hover it for a summary: the plan, then one row per rate window with how much is
gone, how long is left and the clock time it comes back, then today's and this week's
tokens with their cost.

- **Left-click** the pill opens the usage panel.
- **Right-click** forces a refresh.

`pill_extras` puts more beside the percentage: the time left in the window
(`17% · 3h 20m`), the pace against the clock (`↓16` is sixteen points under where the
window says you should be, `↑16` is sixteen over), both, or neither. It describes
whichever window the bar metric tracks — the 5-hour one under `both`, the same window
as the outer ring, so the two never disagree. With pace showing, the bare `↑` off-track
cue steps aside; the number already says it.

Both are `[widget.actions]` defaults, so they are re-bindable in the bar's gesture
settings; the script's own `onClick` / `onRightClick` do the same thing if you remove a
binding.

The panel header names the plan the account is on in words — "Claude Team 5x", rebuilt
from the machine tokens the credentials file actually stores (`team`,
`default_claude_max_5x`). The same name heads the tooltip.

The panel opens attached under the pill and carries the full detail: a card for every
rate window the plan reports, each with a reset countdown, the wall-clock time it lands
on, and a pacing bar, token consumption for today, this
week and this month with estimated cost, a Monday-to-Sunday activity chart you can hover
for a single day's tokens and cost, a per-model breakdown for the current week, all-time
session and message stats, and a profile selector that cycles the CCS instances found in
`~/.ccs/instances/*`. Refresh, settings and close buttons sit in its header.

Open or close it from a terminal with:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle jrohland/claudecode:popout
```

Force a refresh without touching the bar:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin jrohland/claudecode:service all refresh
```

For an always-visible copy, add the desktop widget from the desktop-widget editor
(`noctalia msg desktop-widgets-edit`). It lays out the same panel; being a desktop
surface it takes no hover, so the daily chart has no per-bar detail and the profile
selector is a cycle button rather than a dropdown.

## Settings

Plugin-wide settings live under Settings → Plugins; the rest are per-entry and appear
with the widget.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `refresh_interval` | `int` | `2` | Minutes between background fetches (2–15). |
| `currency` | `select` | `auto` | Cost display: `auto` follows the locale, or force `usd` / `eur`. |
| `pill_metric` | `select` | `five_hour` | Which window the pill reports: `five_hour`, `seven_day`, or `both`. |
| `pill_style` | `select` | `glyph_text` | Pill appearance: glyph + percentage, a circular ring, or ring + percentage. |
| `pill_extras` | `select` | `none` | What rides beside the percentage: `countdown`, `pace`, `both` or `none`. |
| `show_glyph` | `bool` | `true` | Show the Claude glyph next to the percentage. |
| `ring_size` | `int` | `16` | Ring diameter in pixels (10–28). Keep it under the bar height or it clips. |
| `ring_thickness` | `int` | `3` | Ring stroke width in pixels (1–6). |
| `ring_color` | `color` | `#89B4FA` | Ring progress color, used only when the active palette cannot be read (older shells). |
| `accent` | `color` | `primary` | Desktop widget accent. |

The ring draws the 5-hour window in the palette's `primary` color and the 7-day window in
`secondary`, whichever metric is chosen, and each still turns amber or red with its own
pace. A ring's track is its own color at 30%, the way the shell's bar gauges draw theirs,
so it stays visible on any bar background. Under `pill_metric = both` the 7-day window is an inner ring inside the 5-hour one.
Both strokes shrink to two thirds of `ring_thickness` to fit, so the inner ring reads
better with `ring_size` at 20 or more.

The ring is an image, so unlike the text it is not restyled by the shell when the theme
changes: plugins get no palette-change event. On a shell with `noctalia.getColor` it picks
up the new colors on its next redraw, within five seconds.

### Rate windows

The windows come from the API's own list rather than a fixed pair, so a plan gets
exactly the cards it is actually metered on: `Session (5h)`, `Weekly (7d)`, and on plans
that scope a week to one model, that model's own row — `Fable (7d)`. A window Anthropic
adds later appears on its own with no change here.

Each card colors by pace, whether quota is running ahead of the clock. Anthropic also
labels a window `high` or `critical` when it wants attention, and that outranks the pace
arithmetic, so a card never reads calm while the vendor is calling it urgent.

## How it differs from the DMS version

- Noctalia's `ui.*` has no arc primitive, so `ring.luau` generates an SVG and hands it to
  `barWidget.setImage`; the image loader rasterizes it through librsvg.
- An SVG needs literal hex, so `ring.luau` asks the shell for each role with
  `noctalia.getColor` (plugin API 31). On an older shell it resolves the active palette
  itself: custom and community palettes are read from disk, wallpaper palettes are
  re-derived by running `noctalia theme`, and built-in palettes, which live inside the
  shell binary, fall back to `ring_color`.
- Inside the panel and the desktop widget, progress is still linear (`ui.progress`).
- The panel is a fixed 380×640 and scrolls; the DMS popout auto-sizes.

## Architecture

- `get-claude-usage` — the data engine, a Bash script. The plugin runs it with `--json`;
  its default `KEY=value` output and the `tests/` suite are preserved unchanged.
- `service.luau` — headless service: runs the script on the configured interval and
  publishes the parsed result as `usage` and `status`.
- `shared.luau` — formatters, countdown math, pacing model and profile projection,
  required by the three UI entries so they cannot drift on how a number reads.
- `widget.luau` — the bar pill.
- `ring.luau` — the pill's circular-progress SVG and palette resolution.
- `panel.luau` — the click panel.
- `desktop.luau` — the desktop tile.

## Notes

What this plugin touches, so nothing is a surprise:

- **Reads** `~/.claude/.credentials.json` for the OAuth token that authorizes the usage
  query, and enumerates `~/.ccs/instances/*` for the profile selector. The token is sent
  only to Anthropic.
- **Network**: the Anthropic usage API for your account's rate windows; LiteLLM's public
  model-price table to cost the tokens; Frankfurter (ECB rates) for USD to EUR. All over
  HTTPS, on the refresh interval.
- **Spawns** `get-claude-usage` through `bash`, and `noctalia theme` when the ring needs
  a wallpaper-derived palette.
- **Writes** nothing outside the plugin's own data directory.

## Development

Point a `path` source at a checkout; Luau edits hot-reload on save, manifest changes need
a config reload.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jrohland/noctalia-v5-claudecode ~/dev/noctalia-v5-claudecode
noctalia msg plugins source add jrohland-dev path ~/dev/noctalia-v5-claudecode
noctalia msg plugins enable jrohland/claudecode
```

Run the data-engine tests with `bash tests/test-get-claude-usage.sh`. They mock `curl`,
so they need no network and no credentials.

## AI assistance

This plugin was built with AI assistance, and not in a small way: the port from Dank
Material Shell and everything since — the rate-window handling, the generated bar ring,
the two panels, the Bash data engine — were written with Claude Code. The author
directed the work and verified it by running it: every surface exercised on a live
shell, every setting toggled, the data engine's suite run. The author has not read all
~3,400 lines line by line, and would rather say so than imply an audit that did not
happen.

It is written to be read. Plain Luau and Bash, nothing minified, obfuscated or
machine-emitted; a comment on every non-obvious decision saying why it is that way
rather than what it does; and a 92-assertion suite over the data engine's parsing that
needs no network and no credentials to run. If a reviewer finds a line whose purpose is
not clear from the code and its comment, that is worth an issue.
